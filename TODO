Wishlist:
- Use -e for setup and recrypt
- Read password from commandline or file (scriptability)
- Ability to change passwords (recreate dir, or some other way?)
- Ability to reject wrong passwords (try opening?)
- More checks on filesystem for informative errors
- Facility for checking de/recryption status
